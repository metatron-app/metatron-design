CSS
---------------------------------------------
The entire screen is made up of several blocks that are assigned an id or class.

Ex) <div id = ”ddp-table-form”>, <div class = ”ddp-ui-title”>

Each block name is prefixed with “ddp-”, and the only block in the page is given an id, and the class can be given with multiple identical blocks within a page. class is preceded by “.”)
